# PHanalysis

This repository contains the output and figures used in Cunningham et al. (2019). For ten [ROIs](https://mcunningham917.github.io/PHdoc/Data/) we performed the [PH algorithm] (https://mcunningham917.github.io/PHdoc/Method/). This repository has two basic components:

## 1 Scripts to generate output for each ROI

Each script points the PH routine to the proper input (PHdata) and output (PHanalysis) path and sets the axes limits for output figure. 

## 2 Output 

Each ROI folder has three components

### 1: Subcatchments

Includes a .txt file of each PH chain analyzed for each Supercatchment in each ROI.

### 2: PHBs

Includes a .txt for each PHB recorded along each PH chain

### 3: PHB plots
